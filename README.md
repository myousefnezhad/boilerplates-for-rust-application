# Boilerplates for Rust Application
I publish some boilerplates for developing rust applications in this repository

* lib_pgsql provides functions that can enable a Rust struct to be connected with the PostgreSQL database, using [deadpool-postgres](https://crates.io/crates/deadpool-postgres)
* lib_redis provides an implementation of the `Redis` struct, including some functions to connect and interact with the Redis database, using [deadpool-redis](https://crates.io/crates/deadpool-redis)
